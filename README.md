## üèÜ My projects
- Summary-Comparison: Using NLP to compare and contrast open source books from the "booksum" dataset, seeing if better agreement scores can be gained from improving the data. Additionally, analyzing different summarization methods on large chunks of text and testing their similarity against the "booksum" summaries. This was performed as a research project at the Univeristy.
- Diglot Reader: A C++ application for opening & reading text files, replacing English words with Te Reo Maori, performing the substitutions with a mix of ideas, using the 'diglot weave' method and 'space repitition' to help users slowly and effectively increase their maori vocabulary, using English & Maori word freqency data alongside user profiling to specalised experience.
- AI chat-app: A VM provisioning repository, where a DB, AI API, and Webapp are all spun-up with one command, allowing you to talk nonsense with your favourite hugging-face conversational AI responders.
